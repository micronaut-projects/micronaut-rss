See the documentation in the [Micronaut Docs](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#usingsnapshots) for how to configure your build to use snapshots.

Releases are published to JCenter and Maven Central via [Github Actions](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-rss/actions).

A release is performed with the following steps:

- [Publish the draft release](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-rss/releases). There should be already a draft release created, edit and publish it. The Git Tag should start with `v`. For example `v1.0.0`.
- [Monitor the Workflow](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-rss/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease) to check it passed successfully.
- Celebrate!
